This is my own example of a text you might see some day.
This uses only utf8, which is nice.
I was running into problems using things like the other 
text files in this directory. I wonder if a Capital is 
considered differently than a capital using my current 
algorithm.... I'm excited to see how it handles the dots too.
Maybe I should provision for the different kinds of sy,mbols
