I made two tests in driver.py. Run:

python driver.py 

with all the files in the same directory and it should output
something close to what driverOutput.txt has. 


'''
    Test one covers all the tests mentioned in the assignment.
    (1)In addition to the two initial STORE calls to the server in 
    alice.py, alice supplies two more STORE calls through arguments, and even 
    calls a GET. The test then sleeps for 5 seconds to ensure 
    that all of Alice's values get stored before bob starts.
    It will still work correctly if there is no sleep, but there is 
    a chance that Bob will query a key that is not on the server...
    (2)Bob runs three GET calls and one STORE. (3)In the bob.py file,
    one of the GET calls in messages tries to retrieve a key that is
    not stored in the server.

Test two covers more erroneous inputs.
